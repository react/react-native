/**
 * (This is Fabric-compatible RCTSurface implementation.)
 *
 * RCTSurface instance represents React Native-powered piece of a user interface
 * which can be a full-screen app, separate modal view controller,
 * or even small widget.
 * It is called "Surface".
 *
 * The RCTSurface instance is completely thread-safe by design;
 * it can be created on any thread, and any its method can be called from
 * any thread (if the opposite is not mentioned explicitly).
 *
 * The primary goals of the RCTSurface are:
 *  * ability to measure and layout the surface in a thread-safe
 *    and synchronous manner;
 *  * ability to create a UIView instance on demand (later);
 *  * ability to communicate the current stage of the surface granularly.
